# Quizz app

 Simple REACT and Vite exercise for a quizz app.

 The exercise includes an API connection thourght back-end server made with NodeJs and express, with connection to MongoDB through mongoose.

 Is very simple and there's not much to it, I just wanted to try working a REACT app with a back-end server route connection, and data base connection and that's it!

 The front-end is running on vercel and the back-end is running on render.

 You can try the app here --> https://quizz-2a89eh9ow-corinas-projects-81f64978.vercel.app/

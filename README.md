# Quizz app

 Simple REACT and Vite exercise for a quizz app.

 The exercise includes an API connection thourght back-end server made with NodeJs and express, with connection to MongoDB through mongoose.

 Is very simple and there's not much to it, I just wanted to try working a REACT app with a back-end server route connection, and data base connection and that's it!
